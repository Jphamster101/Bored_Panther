# Panther-Plots

This is a Software Engineering project where we were tasked with building out a website that was connected to a database, in order to lookup employees for a fictional lawncare service comapny, Panther Plots.

Node.js was used for the server-side development (RESTful APIs) and MongoDB was the library used in order to manipulate and store values in the database.
